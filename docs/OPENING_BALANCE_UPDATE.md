# Opening Balance Feature Added ‚úÖ

## üéØ **Problem Solved: Opening Balance Integration**

You're absolutely right! The opening balance should be brought forward from the previous month's ending balance. I've now added this crucial feature to the Manual Reconciliation Input System.

## üÜï **New Features Added**

### **1. Opening Balance Section**
- New form field for opening balance
- Auto-populate from previous month's ending balance
- Manual override capability if needed

### **2. Previous Balance API**
- **Endpoint**: `/api/previous-balance/{company}/{period}`
- Automatically finds the previous month's ending balance
- Returns JSON with previous balance and period info

### **3. Enhanced Form**
- **"Load Previous Month Balance"** button
- Automatically calculates opening balance from July ‚Üí August
- Real-time validation and user feedback

### **4. Improved PDF Reports**  
- Opening balance prominently displayed at top
- Shows "Brought Forward" amount clearly
- Professional formatting matching Stripe exactly

## üîÑ **How Opening Balance Works**

### **Example: August 2025 Report**
1. **Enter company**: CGGE
2. **Enter period**: 2025-08  
3. **Click "Load Previous Month Balance"**
4. System looks for July 2025 (2025-07) ending balance
5. **Auto-populates** opening balance field
6. **Shows alert**: "Loaded 2025-07 ending balance: HK$xxx.xx"

### **Flow: July ‚Üí August**
```
July 2025 Reconciliation:
- Total Paid Out: HK$2,450.13
- Ending Balance: HK$554.77

August 2025 Reconciliation:
- Opening Balance: HK$554.77 ‚Üê Brought forward from July
- New transactions...
- Ending Balance: HK$xxx.xx
```

## üìä **Updated Data Structure**

### **Form Fields Now Include**:
```
Opening Balance Section:
- Opening Balance (HKD) [Auto-populated or manual entry]
- "Load Previous Month Balance" button

Payout Reconciliation Section:
- [Existing fields...]

Ending Balance Section:  
- [Existing fields...]
```

### **Saved Data Now Includes**:
```json
{
  "opening_balance": 554.77,
  "charges_count": 15,
  "charges_gross": 2100.00,
  // ... rest of data
}
```

## üè¶ **Balance Continuity Logic**

### **Automatic Chain**:
1. **January ending** ‚Üí **February opening**
2. **February ending** ‚Üí **March opening**  
3. **March ending** ‚Üí **April opening**
4. **...and so on**

### **Manual Override**:
- Can manually enter opening balance if needed
- Useful for:
  - First month setup
  - Corrections
  - One-off adjustments

## üí° **Usage Instructions**

### **Step 1**: Create July Report
1. Enter July reconciliation data
2. Set ending balance (e.g., HK$554.77)
3. Save report

### **Step 2**: Create August Report  
1. Select CGGE and 2025-08
2. Click **"Load Previous Month Balance"**
3. Opening balance auto-fills with HK$554.77
4. Continue with August data entry
5. Generate perfect PDF with proper balance flow

3. **Ending Balance** (money remaining)
4. **Individual Transactions** (optional details)
